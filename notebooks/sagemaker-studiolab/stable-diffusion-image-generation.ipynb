    "# AI Generated Images for your Roboflow Project using Stable Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "[Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) is a deep learning, text-to-image model released in 2022. It is primarily used to generate detailed images conditioned on text descriptions, though it can also be applied to other tasks such as inpainting, outpainting, and generating image-to-image translations guided by a text prompt. In this notebook, we'll use Stable Diffusion to generate images for your Computer Vision project, and push those images into your [Roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/synthetic-data-with-stable-diffusion-a-guide/) project for annotating. We will be using [Amazon SageMaker Studio Lab](https://studiolab.sagemaker.aws/). At the end, we'll have quality, AI generated, representative data to further enrich your dataset and strengthen your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many thanks to the CompVis group LMU Munich, Runway and Stability AI for releasing [the code](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Steps Covered in this Tutorial**\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate our images we will cover the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Install Stable Diffusion dependencies\n",
    "* Getting latest model version - runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5 - from Hugging Face hub\n",
    "* Create function to generate images\n",
    "* Generate images based on your prompt of choice\n",
    "* Upload images to your Roboflow project using Roboflow PIP package\n",
    "* Begin Annotating"

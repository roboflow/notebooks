    "### Step 1: Sign up for a free Roboflow account\n",
    "\n",
    "[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/?ref=studiolab) is an end-to-end computer vision platform. It helps you [create](https://docs.roboflow.com/quick-start?ref=studiolab), [understand](https://blog.roboflow.com/dataset-search/?ref=studiolab), and [use](https://docs.roboflow.com/exporting-data?ref=studiolab) image datasets to train and deploy custom models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboflow strives to be broadly interoperable and can import and export object detection datasets in [dozens of formats](https://roboflow.com/formats?ref=studiolab). They maintain [training notebooks](https://models.roboflow.com/?ref=studiolab) (like this one) for many state of the art computer vision models, and also offer [AutoML training](https://docs.roboflow.com/train?ref=studiolab) which can be useful for [prototyping](https://blog.roboflow.com/deploy-tab/?ref=studiolab), [model assisted labeling](https://roboflow.com/annotate?ref=studiolab), and even [deploying to a wide range of targets and edge devices](https://roboflow.com/deploy?ref=studiolab).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will use Roboflow to annotate a custom dataset and export it for use with YOLOv7 in this notebook. But we encourage you to explore [its other features](https://roboflow.com/features?ref=studiolab) as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create a Public Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboflow offers a [generous free tier](https://roboflow.com/pricing?ref=studiolab) if your data can be shared publicly with others on [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/?ref=studiolab). There are also paid plans available for private data.\n",

    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zfE5MZL.png\" style=\"max-width: 600px;\"></div>\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Step 3: Create a Project\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create an `Object Detection` project (be sure to give it a descriptive name, and fill in the `What will your model predict?` section since they will make your project more understandable and be pulled in via the API later, and can serve as helpful metadata later for advanced use-cases like automated prompt engineering for zero-shot models).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/O2xDyxQ.png\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4: Upload your Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, drop image (or video) files into the UI and, optionally, drop existing annotations in [any supported format](https://roboflow.com/formats?ref=studiolab). Alternatively you can use the [Upload API](https://docs.roboflow.com/adding-data/upload-api?ref=studiolab) or [load images from an S3 bucket](https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-use-s3-computer-vision-pipeline/?ref=studiolab).\n",

    "\n",
    "_**Note:** To get good, generalizable results you will need lots of images covering a wide variety of situations and edge cases. Exactly how many images you need [depends on a wide variety of factors](https://blog.roboflow.com/images-train-model/?ref=studiolab), but we recommend starting out with at least 200 for most use-cases. If you need more images, try sourcing from open source datasets on [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/?ref=studiolab) with images similar to yours._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Annotate\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note:** If you imported annotations from another labeling tool or open source dataset, you can skip this step._\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we'll use [Roboflow Annotate](https://roboflow.com/annotate?ref=studiolab) to create annotations that will teach our model what we're trying to detect in our images. Since your model will learn to mimic your annotations, it's important that you give some thought to how you label your images ahead of time. We've compiled a list of [best practices to consider when labeling images](https://blog.roboflow.com/tips-for-how-to-label-images/?ref=studiolab).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can either choose to annotate the images yourself, or invite a friend to your workspace to help out for double the fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "<video loop autoplay controls src=\"https://i.imgur.com/AuDAPs4.mp4\">Annotate Images</video>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Add to Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have annotated 200 images or more, you're ready to add them to your dataset. At this point you'll choose how to split your images into train, valid, and test sets. We usually recommend keeping the 70/20/10 ratio unless you have more than a few thousand images, in which case you might want to add a higher percentage to your test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/XUVE6uq.png\" style=\"max-width: 400px;\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're an advanced user, you can also choose to craft these sets by hand to verify that your model is going to generalize well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: View the Health Check (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboflow includes a [dataset health check](https://docs.roboflow.com/dataset-health-check?ref=studiolab) which gives information about your class balance, box distribution, and image sizes. Checking this can help you choose good preprocessing and augmentation steps while generating a version of your dataset which can improve your model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you discover your objects are all clustered around the center of the image, you may want to [apply a static crop](https://docs.roboflow.com/image-transformations/image-preprocessing#static-crop) so your model can focus only on the important parts of the image. Or if your images have giant dimensions compared to your objects of interes, [you might want to apply tiling](https://blog.roboflow.com/detect-small-objects/?ref=studiolab).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8: Generate a Version\n",
    "\n",
    "Roboflow helps you version control your datasets so that you can get repeatable results & track changes and performance over time. It also lets you preprocess and augment your images which can speed up your training time and improve your model's results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose your preprocessing steps. For YOLOv5, we recommend [Auto-Orient](https://blog.roboflow.com/exif-auto-orientation/?ref=studiolab) and Resize (Stretch to 640x640), which is YOLOv5's default input size. You may also want to [enable Tiling](https://blog.roboflow.com/edge-tiling-during-inference/?ref=studiolab) if your objects are very small compared to the size of your images (if you're not sure, try training a model first without, and if you get poor results you can try again).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SZojEwP.png\" style=\"max-width: 400px;\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, choose your desired augmentations. YOLOv5 does online augmentations during training automatically, so if you have more than 500 annotated images in your dataset you can usually skip this step. But for smaller datasets we've seen good results adding some basic augmentations which mimic things your model may see in the while. We recommend **not** adding Cutout or Mosaic for YOLOv5 as these are already applied during training and applying them twice produces poor results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, click `Generate` to lock in your choices and render your images.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Export for YOLOv5\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've generated a dataset version, click `Export` and select the `YOLO v5 PyTorch` format and the `show download code` option.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/luQC9Rg.png\" style=\"max-width: 500px;\"></div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This will convert your dataset to the proper format and make it available for use in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Copy Your Snippet\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you're all set, simply copy and paste the download snippet from the `Jupyter` tab into the code cell below and you're ready to train your custom YOLOv5 model.\n",

    "### Step 4: Choose a Dataset Version\n",
